    \footnotesize{You track south along the Imperial pass until you reach the site where one of the caravans you’ve been told about must have gone missing. There is indeed a trail of deserted wagons standing neatly parked in the middle of the road. From the looks of it, they must’ve been abandoned quite recently, although something seems amiss: you find no signs of a battle or even struggle. A quick sweep of the area leads to a surprising discovery - several rows of footprints in the snow trail away from the caravan, as if its occupants just packed everything up and wandered off in the same direction. You follow the tracks to a nearby cave that seems to have been opened a short time ago, judging by the shards of shattered ice shards you see scattered around the entrance.\newline\newline
With no other option left you shrug and step into the cave. A long way down awaits you inside. Cautiously, you press on and follow it for what your rational mind knows to be minutes but your feeling keeps insisting must be an eternity and a half. Just as you start thinking it’ll never end, you spot a slight turn, and as you pass it, a sudden flash of bright light blinds you momentarily. An unnatural pressure builds up in your ears and for a brief moment, a sensation of drowning threatens to overwhelm you. The tension subsides with a loud pop, as abruptly as it began.\newline\newline
Your vision returns, greeting you with a most unusual vista: the tunnel opens up into a large grotto with an azure lake shining with a ghostly blue light, its thousandfold reflections weaving breathtaking patterns among crystalline stalactites and stalagmites. Even more surprising, and, in fact, alarming, is the sight of the grotto’s occupants. As the sound of a battle finally reaches your ears, you doubt, for a second at least, your sparkle-dazed eyesight. Algox, fighting Unfettered? You’ve never seen either of these creatures this far south. You watch the scene playing out before you with a mixture of puzzlement and unease at first, but then you spot the supplies from the caravan Frosthaven needs so desperately. It seems as if you’ll have to fight them both or wait until one side has annihilated the other and mop up the rest if you want to secure the goods. Still, you can’t help but wonder what happened to the caravan.}

		\footnotesize{You find a shattered decanter of what appears to be wine. It is still wet, meaning it must have been broken recently. Whoever wasted the beverage left plenty of footprints around the area - footprints made by humanoid boots. You almost gasp in surprise as you follow the tracks with your eyes, all the way to the fighting (or defeated) savages and machines. What happened to the humans, orchids and inox though?}

		\footnotesize{You find a dead caravan guard, their body mangled by cuts and bruises. You pause to take a closer look. No tufts of fur or broken metal parts litter the scene. From what you can tell, the guard wasn’t killed by brute force or a nefarious contraption, but by a very mundane blade. A blade just like the one they’re clutching in their cold hand. }

		\footnotesize{You find no clues about what happened here, only some smashed up supplies and crates that seem to have been already plundered some time ago. With contempt, you turn away, when you see something gleaming in the corner of your eye. A quick search reveals something the looters must have overlooked.}

		\footnotesize{A grisly sight awaits you - a hapless human being, torn to shreds by the claws or pincers of some bizarre monster. Your stomach churns for a moment, but being a battle-hardened mercenary, you have seen far worse. As you examine the remains closer, you notice that the body and its garments are soaking wet, not only with blood but with water as well. The dead person’s face is a grimace of terror.}

		\footnotesize{Curiously, you find some open crates that haven’t been looted. Judging by the layer of dust on them, they must’ve been left behind a long time ago, their contents being apparently of no interest to whoever opened them. A quick sift through said contents proves disappointing - it’s just books, scrolls and more books, all of them waterlogged and ruined. With stubborn determination, you dig deeper and are finally rewarded for your impeccable instinct. There’s indeed something else hidden beneath all the useless paper and parchment, a contraband consisting of an inconspicuous package and a potion that you recognize as being banned a long time ago.}

		\footnotesize{Succumbing to his grievous wounds, the massive Algox stumbles and collapses on the ground.

Instead, it simply collapses on the ground in some form of slumber. This seems peculiar to say the least, but the battle’s still raging on and you need those supplies for Frosthaven. You gain a clue about your enemies.}

		\footnotesize{Machines made of cold steel aren’t supposed to be weakened by poison or bleed like a living being, but this is exactly what you’re witnessing. While it does make dispatching them much easier for you, an anomaly like this is more than conspicuous. A suspicion crawls into your mind - maybe not everything is as it seems.}

Still, your senses are trying to convince you that they are exactly that. Maybe you shouldn’t trust your senses fully, and maybe these creatures are also perceiving something else than you are. What if they are just victims of something - or somebody - else? There are probably more clues to be found deeper in the cave.}

		\footnotesize{The clues you’ve gathered point to the subterranean lake. Maybe the culprit responsible for this whole mess is hiding there. Unfortunately, the shimmering light reflected by the crystals inside the cave makes it impossible to see beneath the lake’s surface. The crystals don’t look very sturdy, though - barely a challenge for experts at smashing things such as yourselves! Maybe if you destroy the biggest ones the light will stop blinding you and you can finally strike true.}

		\end{center}
		\footnotesize{With the reflecting crystals gone you can finally see through the surface of the small lake. You’ve never seen anything like this before - a lurker with multiple arms, a shimmering purple carapace and an enlarged cranium. You feel malicious intent radiating from it as a slight buzz builds up inside your skull. Whatever that lurker is, you are sure it is responsible for fooling your senses and mind. If you manage to bring it down, maybe this nightmare can end before more innocents must die.}

		\footnotesize{You triumph over your enemies, and the spoils are now yours for the taking. Even though you could not find anybody to save, at least the supplies will be put to good use. For a brief moment, you wonder again what happened to the caravaneers, when the grotto blurs before your eyes and nausea sets in. The feeling lasts only for a fraction of a second, but as soon as your vision clears, a dreadful realization sets in: all the Algox und Unfettered you’ve slain have turned into an assortment of Humans, Inox, Quatryls and Orchids. Their blood is on your hands now - you have been fooled. Fuming with fury, you search the rest of the cave, but there is no sign of any other enemy. You let out an exasperated sigh. It seems there is nothing left to do for you here than to scavenge what you can and make sure nobody stumbles upon this cursed place ever again.\newline\newline
You leave the cave and vent your frustration by sealing the entrance with some good old-fashioned brute force before you head back to Frosthaven, silent and sullen. When you arrive you are welcomed, but the faces soon turn sour as you break the news that the caravaneers are all dead and nobody will be coming. Although you don’t go into detail about what happened, some people seem to notice that there must be something more to your story, and for several days, a gloomy, somber mood spreads over the outpost like a bleak cloud.}

The feeling of triumph doesn’t last long as you quickly confirm your suspicions: instead of monstrous foes, dead bodies of the caravaneers litter the ground of the grotto, struck down in self-defense by your party. You sigh at the sight, but at least you can rest easy knowing that nobody will fall prey to this strange lurker with powers you have never witnessed before again. Still, there’s nothing left to do for you than to scavenge what you can and head back to Frosthaven. You are welcomed upon your arrival, and even though you shock the people as you break the news of the caravaneer’s grim fate, they find solace in the knowledge that you’ve put an end to the horror. A glimmer of hope that from now on, caravans will reach their destination blooms in the outpost. Only time will tell if it is more than wishful thinking.}

To your relief, it appears that it has been lifted from your foes as well: as you turn towards them, you no longer see any Algox or Unfettered. Instead - just as you suspected - the missing caravaneers stand around you, staring in confusion and horror at the bodies at their feet. You hurry to their side to steady whoever needs it and explain to them what really happened. The survivors are relieved and shaken at the same time. Before morale can fall any lower you offer to escort them to their original destination, Frosthaven. There’s little time to mourn as the outpost is in dire need of supplies, so you lend a hand with packing up the scattered crates and barrels. While doing so you realize that the caravaneers have lost so many people that you see no harm in taking some of the provisions for yourselves. Together, you embark on the long journey to Frosthaven.\newline\newline
When the citizens of Frosthaven spot you at the head of a small caravan, they look relieved. As soon as you trot through the gate you are swarmed by curious people eager to hear every single detail about what happened at the pass, while the strained new members of the community get help from the older citizens. You have done Frosthaven a great service and restored hope - the supplies will help the outpost prosper, and so will the survivors - in time, as they are barely able to fight in their current shape.}

The caravaneers are grateful beyond words for your intervention and the risks you took to prevent further bloodshed. None of them object as you offer to escort them to Frosthaven.

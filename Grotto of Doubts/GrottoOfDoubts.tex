    \footnotesize{You track south along the imperial pass until you reach the site where one of the caravans you’ve been told about must have gone missing. From the looks of it, it must’ve happened very recently, although something seems amiss: the wagons - all of them empty - stand neatly parked in the middle of the road. You find no signs of a battle or even struggle. A quick sweep of the area leads to a surprising discovery - several rows of footprints in the snow trail away from the caravan, as if its occupants just packed everything up and wandered off in the same direction. You follow the tracks to a nearby cave that seems to have been opened a short time ago, judging by the shards of shattered ice shards you see scattered around the entrance.\newline\newline
With no other option left you shrug and step into the cave. A long way down awaits you inside. Cautiously, you press on and follow it for what your rational mind knows to be minutes but your feeling keeps insisting must be an eternity and a half. Just as you start thinking it’ll never end, you spot a slight turn, and as you pass it, a sudden flash of bright light blinds you momentarily. An unnatural pressure builds up in your ears and for a brief moment, a sensation of drowning threatens to overwhelm you. The tension subsides with a loud pop, as abruptly as it began.\newline\newline
Your vision returns, greeting you with a most unusual vista: the tunnel opens up into a large grotto with an azure lake shining with a ghostly blue light, its thousandfold reflections weaving breathtaking patterns among crystalline stalactites and stalagmites. Even more surprising, and, in fact, alarming, is the sight of the grotto’s occupants. As the sound of a battle finally reaches your ears, you doubt, for a second at least, your sparkle-dazed eyesight. Algox, fighting Unfettered? You’ve never seen either of these creatures this far south. You watch the scene playing out before you with a mixture of puzzlement and unease at first, but then you spot the supplies from the caravan Frosthaven needs so desperately. It seems as if you’ll have to fight them both or wait until one side has annihilated the other and mop up the rest if you want to secure the goods. Still, you can’t help but wonder what happened to the caravan.}

	  \footnotesize{All Algox figures are allies to each other and enemies to all other figures. Robotic Boltshooters and Ruined Machines are allies to each other and enemies to all other figures. Remove Self-Destruct from the Ruined Machine ability deck. Randomly place number tokens 1 to 3 face down on the hexes marked with “a” on the map. Randomly place number tokens 4 to 6 face down on the hexes marked with “b” on the map. The face down number tokens represent clues that characters can investigate to find out more about what happened to the caravan. Flip a token face up if you loot the hex containing it by using a loot action or end of turn looting and read the section corresponding to the revealed number.\newline\newline
The first time an Algox Archer or Guard is defeated, read section 7. The first time a Robotic Boltshooter or Ruined Machine is defeated, read section 8. The first time a Robotic Boltshooter or Ruined Machine would be poisoned or wounded, read section 9. At the end of round 4 door “c” opens if it hasn’t already been opened. At the end of round 8 door “d” opens if it hasn’t already been opened. If all enemies are killed, read conclusion 1.}

		\footnotesize{You find a shattered decanter of what appears to be wine. It is still wet, meaning it must have been broken recently. Whoever wasted the beverage left plenty of footprints around the area - footprints made by humanoid boots. You almost gasp in surprise as you follow the tracks with your eyes, all the way to the fighting (or defeated) savages and machines. What happened to the humans, orchids and inox though? You gain a clue about your enemies. If you have collected 4 clues, read section 10.}

		\footnotesize{You find a dead caravan guard, their body mangled by cuts and bruises. You pause to take a closer look. No tufts of fur or broken metal parts litter the scene. From what you can tell, the guard wasn’t killed by brute force or a nefarious contraption, but by a very mundane blade. A blade just like the one they’re clutching in their cold hand. You gain a clue about your enemies. If you have collected 4 clues, read section 10.}

		\footnotesize{You find no clues about what happened here, only some smashed up supplies and crates that seem to have been already plundered some time ago.
